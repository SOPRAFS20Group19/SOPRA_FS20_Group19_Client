# KNOW YOUR CITY
Take a look at the current running version of the application [here](https://sopra-fs20-group-19-client.herokuapp.com/map).

This is a SoPra Project from Students at the University of Zurich, realized in FS20.

## Introduction

KNOW YOUR CITY is a complement to ubiquitous map services as Google Maps. It should help people find places of everyday life: 

- Fountains
- Fireplaces
- Toilets
- Recycling Stations 
- Table Tennis Spots
- Beautiful Benches

Our target audience are people who want to spend a nice summer evening in Zurich with BBQ and a round of table tennis. But don't forget about the others: A normal resident could find a new recycling station here. Or what if a stressed businessman has to pee urgently while travelling? KNOW YOUR CITY will show him the nearest toilet for sure.

Furthermore, the application is a remote meeting place for people who want to get to know their city better. You can: 

- rate locations
- leave a comment about a location
- chat with your friends
- take a look at your friends favorite locations
- add a new location if it's missing in the database.

Have fun!

## Technologies

Client:
- React: Used to design the User Interface with JavaScript
- Heroku: Used to build, run and deploy the application

Server:
- SpringBoot: Used to build the REST service with Spring
- MongoDB: Database used to store all location and user data
- Gradle: Used to build the application
- Postman: Used to test the API calls
- SonarQube: Used to analyse code and test quality


## High-level components

- [Map](https://github.com/SOPRAFS20Group19/SOPRA_FS20_Group19_Client/blob/master/src/components/map/Map.js) controls the most important component of the application: the map. It handles the current position of the user and stores the chosen filters if the user wants to see just some specific location types.
- [MapService](https://github.com/SOPRAFS20Group19/SOPRA_FS20_Group19_Client/blob/master/src/components/map/MapService.js) is called by Map and renders the map itself by accessing the Google Maps API and our MongoDB database to get coordinates and informations about our locations which it shows to the user with the help of Map Markers and Popups after clicking on such a Marker.
- [AppRouter](https://github.com/SOPRAFS20Group19/SOPRA_FS20_Group19_Client/blob/master/src/components/shared/routers/AppRouter.js) controls which components are rendered for each specific URL path. Like that it handles a crucial part of the logic of the application. For example it calls [MapRouter](https://github.com/SOPRAFS20Group19/SOPRA_FS20_Group19_Client/blob/master/src/components/shared/routers/MapRouter.js) if the map should be displayed. MapRouter then controls which components are rendered for each specific URL path in connection with the map.
- [App](https://github.com/SOPRAFS20Group19/SOPRA_FS20_Group19_Client/blob/master/src/App.js) is the main class of the file, rendering AppRouter. 

## Launch & Deployment

As a new developer, first zip download or git clone our repository.

For your local development environment you'll need Node.js >= 8.10. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies including React get installed with:

### `npm install`

This has to be done before starting the application for the first time (only once).

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console. It is recommended to use Google Chrome.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Every push to the master branch automatically redeploys the heroku application and thus is "going live". If you don't want that you have to push to another branch because every push to the master is automatically a new release.

You can add some additional information to help other users decide if they want to go to that location or not:

## Roadmap 

As a new developer you could add the following functionalities: 

- Users could upload pictures of the locations for a better understanding of how this place looks.

- The database could be extended to bigger regions than just the city of Zurich.

- Users could filter for their favorite locations on the map.
