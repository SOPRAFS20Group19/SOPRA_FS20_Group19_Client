- Read the React [Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Do this React [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) Tutorial (it doesnâ€™t assume any existing React knowledge)
- Get an Understanding of [CSS](http://localhost:3000) and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)!

Once you have done all of this, in the template there are two main external dependencies that you should look at:

- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)
  It removes the mapping between components and styles (i.e. external css files). This means that when you're defining your styles, you're actually creating a normal React component, that has your styles attached to it
* [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) Declarative routing for React being a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. 

<!-- ## IDE Recommendation
As a student, you have the possibility with [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) to obtain a free individual license and have access to several IDEs. 
We recommend you to use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/specials/webstorm/webstorm.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyPOj5f723wIVqRXTCh3SKwtYEAAYASAAEgLtMvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) for your front-end. 
Once you have downloaded and installed it, you can add the following WebStorm plugins: 
> Go to Preferences > Plugins > Browse Repositories and look for: 
* [styled-components](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9997-styled-components) (provides coding assistance like CSS Highlighting for Styled Components)
* [prettier](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10456-prettier) (a smart code formatter)
* [Material Theme UI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui) (Material Theme for Jetbrains IDEs, allowing a total customization of the IDE including Themes, Color Schemes, Icons and many other features.)

Feel free to use other IDEs (e.g. [VisualStudio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) if you want.  -->

## Prerequisites and Installation

For your local development environment you'll need Node.js >= 8.10. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies including React get installed with:

### `npm install`

This has to be done before starting the application for the first time (only once).

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome!).

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
